# UI Test Automation Seed (CucumberJS + Selenium 4)

This repository is a small template project for UI end‑to‑end test automation using **CucumberJS** and **Selenium WebDriver 4**.

It is used as part of a laboratory class in software testing / UI test automation at the **University of Debrecen**, and is intended for students learning how to write automated UI tests in JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed **before** working with this project. Prefer the latest **LTS** (long‑term support) versions unless instructed otherwise in your lab.

- **Node.js LTS (includes npm)**  
  Used to run the test code and manage dependencies.  
  Download: https://nodejs.org/en/download

- **Git (optional but recommended)**  
  Used to clone this repository. You can also download it as a ZIP from GitHub.  
  Download: https://git-scm.com/downloads

- **Web browser (recommended: Google Chrome)**  
  The default setup of this project assumes Chrome as the target browser.  
  Download Chrome: https://www.google.com/chrome

- **Code editor / IDE**  
  Any editor works; Visual Studio Code is recommended.  
  Download VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

## Install

1. **Get the project source**
   - Option A – using Git:
     ```powershell
     git clone https://github.com/L4tabar/de-ui-testing-selenium-seed.git
     cd de-ui-testing-selenium-seed
     ```
   - Option B – download ZIP from GitHub:
     - Go to the repository page in your browser.  
     - Click **Code → Download ZIP**.  
     - Extract the ZIP and open a terminal in the extracted folder.

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   In the project root (where `package.json` is located), run:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
   This will download and install all required npm packages (CucumberJS, Selenium WebDriver, etc.). The first run may take a few minutes.

## How to Run Tests

From the project root, run:

```powershell
npm test
```

This will:
- Execute all `.feature` files under the `features/` folder using CucumberJS.
- Use Selenium WebDriver to drive the browser (Chrome by default).
- Print test progress and results in the terminal.
- Generate a `cucumber.json` report file in the project root.

You can stop a running test run at any time with `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

> **Note for labs:** Your instructor may provide specific test URLs, scenarios, or tags to use (for example, only run `@lab1` tests). Follow the lab handout if there are additional run instructions.

## Project Structure

At a high level, the repository is organized as follows:

- `features/`  
  Gherkin `.feature` files that describe test scenarios in a human‑readable, behavior‑driven style.

- `step_definitions/`  
  - `index.js`: step definition implementations.  
  Maps the Gherkin steps in `features/` to JavaScript functions that use Selenium WebDriver.

- `support/`  
  - `driver.js`: sets up and configures the Selenium WebDriver instance (browser driver).  
  - `hooks.js`: Cucumber hooks (code that runs before and after scenarios, e.g., opening/closing the browser).  
  - `index.js`: support entry point and shared helpers (required from Cucumber so support code is loaded).

- `package.json`  
  NPM metadata and dependency list, including the `"test"` script that runs CucumberJS. You generally do not need to edit this for basic lab work.

- `cucumber.json`  
  JSON report file generated by test runs (used by reporting tools; safe to delete between runs if needed).
